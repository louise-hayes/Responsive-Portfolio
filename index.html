            <h3>What I'd Like You To Know: </h3>
            <p>
                I bring a lot of different hats to the table. I obtained my programming 3 year technical college Diploma 20 years ago, in
                Galway RTC Ireland. After a brief Cobol and Pascal programmer role I landed in SAP. I spent 7 years working
                in large ERP companies installing, taking apart and upgrading SAP systems on multiple hardware, OS and DB
                platforms. I eventually became an SAP Basis performance optimizer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ran my own Web hosting and developing company for 10 years with my partner. I was the jack of all trades, the account manager,
                tester, mockup maker, dream weaver, Google analyzer, SEO optimizer, client liason, trainer, documentation
                maker, graphics designer, E-commerce builder, Joomla, Wordpress and Typo3 content manage and frontend developer.
            </p>
        

        <p>I am technology mad and am very happy to be programming full stack, after many years of trying different areas in
            the technology field.
        </p>
